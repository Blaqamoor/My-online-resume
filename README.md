# My-online-resume
What the project is:
This project is a simple online resume built using only HTML. It presents my personal and professional information in a clear, structured format and serves as my first hosted web project on here.

What I learned:
Through this project, I learned how to structure a complete web page using HTML, work with headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links, and create a multi page website. I also learned how to deploy a static website using GitHub Pages and debug common hosting issues.
